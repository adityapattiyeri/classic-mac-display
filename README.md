## Component list
1. Any variant of ESP32/8266 boards should work just fine, but the case has been designed around the ESP32 Feather Board.

2. I have used a small 1.54" Waveshare eink display, you can alter the design of the case to accomodate the display of your choice.

## Wiring & Assembly
The wiring can be done either by using the included jumper cables or can directly be soldered onto the board. I choose the second option to make the case even more compact.
Be careful while assembilng the components as the supports are quite faragile. I broke mine while installing and just used hot glue instead.

Your support will help me make more cool projects just like this one :-)
