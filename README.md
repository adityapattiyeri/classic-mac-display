# classic-mac-display
Esphome powered eink display in a 3d printed classic mac case!

## Functionality
The code currently displays the progress of the 3d printer using data form octoprint. Any data can be displayed by altering the code.

## Component list
1. Any variant of ESP32/8266 boards should work just fine, but the case has been designed around the ESP32 Feather Board.
